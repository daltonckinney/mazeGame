# Maze Game 

This game will have multiple game modes

Singleplayer: Simple maze game with randomely (maybe procedurally) generated maps
Objective is to simply exit the maze or collect trinkets along the way.

Chase: Same as singleplayer but there will now be an enemy who attempts to find the player in the maze
Could possible have some lockers or something that the player will be able to hide in.

Multiplayer: Will allow for the players to play on either a connection with a server, or on the same
computer by using the wasd and arrow keys for each player.

# Forseeable future plans
Would like to use this project as a stepping stone to see if I can train an ai or use machine
learning principles against the randomely generated maps as a way to learn the technology. This may bea separate project
